# 🎯 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This beginner-level machine learning project uses K-Means clustering to group customers based on behavior like spending, frequency, and recency. It helps businesses target the right group with the right marketing strategies.

## 📁 Dataset

- `customer_segmentation_data.xlsx`: Contains 10 customer records with features like:
  - Monthly Spend
  - Visits Per Month
  - Average Session Time
  - Last Purchase Days

## 🚀 Objective

- Segment customers into behavioral groups
- Visualize clusters using 2D plots
- Understand which customers are high-value vs. low-engagement

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- K-Means Clustering (from `sklearn.cluster`)

## 📊 Output

- Clustered groups shown with different colors on a scatter plot
- Labels assigned to each customer

## 🧠 How to Run

1. Upload the dataset into your Colab session.
2. Run all cells in the notebook.
3. Modify parameters to explore different clustering outcomes.
